Hostslist created with data of the EasyPrivacy filter list of the [EasyList filter list project](https://easylist.to).

Filter list: <https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt>  

The IPv4 version maps the IP address [0.0.0.0](http://0.0.0.0) to each hostname, while the simple hostlist is just a list of hostnames.
