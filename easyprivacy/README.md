# About

Hostslist created from the EasyPrivacy filter list of the [EasyList filter list project](https://easylist.to). The hosts list from <https://firebog.net> is used as source.

Filter list: <https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt>  
Hosts list: <https://v.firebog.net/hosts/Easyprivacy.txt>

The IPv4 version maps the IP address [0.0.0.0](http://0.0.0.0) to each hostname, while the simple hosts list is just a list of hostnames.
